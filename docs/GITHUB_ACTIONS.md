## Recommended Workflows

### 1. CI: Build and Test (Active)

**Purpose**: Verify code compiles and all tests pass on every push/PR

**Workflow name**: `ci-build-test.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` branch
- Every pull request
- Manual dispatch

**Jobs**:
- Setup Java 25 toolchain (from gradle.properties)
- Run `./gradlew clean test`
- Upload test results/coverage
- Report failures

**Why needed**:
- Catch breakages before merging
- Ensure JDK 25 compatibility across environments (local system uses JDK 26)
- Verify Gradle builds consistently in CI
- Gate PRs: make this a branch protection requirement

**Estimated runtime**: 4-6 minutes

**Example output**:
```
✓ Build successful (45s)
✓ Unit tests passed (180 tests, 120s)
✓ Integration tests passed (12 tests, 60s)
```

---

### 2. 🟡 Code Quality & Linting (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Purpose**: Enforce code quality standards on every PR

**Workflow name**: `code-quality.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests
- Push to main

**Jobs**:

#### a) Checkstyle
- Enforce Java code style conventions
- Config: `checkstyle.xml` (create if needed)
- Checks: naming, imports, whitespace, comments

#### b) SpotBugs
- Detect potential bugs in Java code
- Scans for common mistakes (null checks, resource leaks, etc.)
- Gradle plugin: `com.github.spotbugs`

#### c) SonarQube (optional)
- Static code analysis
- Code coverage metrics
- Technical debt tracking
- Can integrate with SonarCloud for free (public repos)

**Why needed**:
- Consistent code style across codebase
- Early bug detection before code review
- Supports REFACTORING.md goal: code quality standards
- Prevents accumulation of technical debt

**Estimated runtime**: 3-5 minutes

**Example output**:
```
✓ Checkstyle: 0 violations
✓ SpotBugs: 0 high-priority issues
✓ Code coverage: 72%
```

---

### 3. 🟡 Dependency Scanning (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Purpose**: Detect and manage vulnerable dependencies

**Workflow options**:

#### a) GitHub Dependabot (Recommended - Free & Automatic)
- **Setup**: Create `.github/dependabot.yml`
- **Auto-creates PRs** for new versions and security updates
- No workflow needed; GitHub handles it
- Already free for public repos

#### b) OWASP Dependency Check
- Gradle plugin: `org.owasp.dependencycheck`
- Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependency tree
- Workflow triggers on schedule (daily/weekly) or PR

#### c) Gradle Vulnerability Scanner
- Built into modern Gradle versions
- Task: `./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze`

**Why needed**:
- Spring Boot ecosystem has frequent security patches
- Catch vulnerable dependencies early
- Automatic updates reduce manual work
- Phase D (reliability/security) requirement

**Estimated runtime**: Automatic (Dependabot) or 2-3 minutes (check)

**Example output**:
```
✓ No known vulnerabilities found
[Optional] Dependabot PR: Bump spring-boot from 3.5.14 to 3.5.15
```

---

### 4. 🟢 Commit Message Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Purpose**: Enforce Conventional Commits format on all PRs

**Workflow name**: `commit-validation.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Pull requests (checks all commits in PR)

**Tool options**:
- `commitlint`: Industry standard tool
- GitHub Action: `compilerla/conventional-pre-commit@v2` or `wagoid/commitlint-github-action`

**Configuration** (`.commitlintrc.json`):
```json
{
  "extends": ["@commitlint/config-conventional"],
  "rules": {
    "type-enum": [2, "always", [
      "feat", "fix", "docs", "style", "refactor", "test", "chore", "ci"
    ]],
    "type-case": [2, "always", "lowercase"],
    "subject-case": [2, "always", "lowercase"]
  }
}
```

**Why needed**:
- Aligns with your custom instructions (atomic commits + conventional commits)
- Enforces team consistency
- Enables automated changelog generation in future
- Prevents messy commit history

**Estimated runtime**: < 1 minute

**Example output**:
```
✓ Commit "feat: add AniList support" matches format
✓ Commit "fix: null pointer in cache" matches format
✗ Commit "WIP stuff" does NOT match format → FAIL
```

---

### 5. 🟢 Documentation Validation (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Purpose**: Check markdown files and maintain documentation quality

**Workflow name**: `docs-validation.yml`

**Triggers**:
- PRs that modify `.md` files
- Optional: push to main

**Jobs**:

#### a) Markdownlint
- Check markdown syntax and style
- Config: `.markdownlintrc`
- Catches: trailing spaces, line length, header format, etc.

#### b) Link Checker
- Verify all URLs in markdown are valid/reachable
- Tool: `gaurav-nelson/github-action-markdown-link-check`
- Prevents broken documentation links

#### c) Schema Validation (optional)
- Validate YAML in docs (e.g., configuration examples)

**Why needed**:
- Catch typos in ARCHITECTURE.md, REFACTORING.md, README.md
- Verify documentation links don't break
- Maintain professional documentation quality
- Prevent stale/outdated docs from being committed

**Estimated runtime**: < 2 minutes

**Example output**:
```
✓ REFACTORING.md: No markdown errors
✓ All links in README.md are valid
✗ ARCHITECTURE.md has trailing spaces on line 42
```

---

### 6. 🟢 Build Artifact & Release (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Purpose**: Automate release builds and publish artifacts

**Workflow name**: `release.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Git tags matching `v*` (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `v2.1.3`)

**Jobs**:
- Compile with `./gradlew clean bootJar`
- Create GitHub Release
- Upload JAR artifact
- (Optional) Deploy to Maven Central / GitHub Packages

**Why needed**:
- Automated release process (no manual steps)
- Users can download pre-built JARs from releases
- Reproducible builds for each version
- Tag-based workflow is standard for Java projects

**Estimated runtime**: 5-8 minutes

**Example workflow**:
```bash
# Developer creates a release:
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# GitHub Actions automatically:
# 1. Builds JAR: anime-1.0.0.jar
# 2. Creates Release on GitHub
# 3. Uploads JAR + checksum
# 4. Users can now download from releases page
```

**Example output**:
```
✓ Built anime-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar (12 MB)
✓ Created GitHub Release v1.0.0
✓ Uploaded artifact
```

---

### 7. 🔵 Docker Image Build (LOW PRIORITY - Future)

**Purpose**: Build and push Docker images for easy containerization

**Workflow name**: `docker-build.yml`

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` (build as `latest`)
- Git tags (build as versioned image)

**Prerequisites**:
- Create `Dockerfile` in repo root
- Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry account (optional)

**Jobs**:
- Build Docker image
- Run security scan (Trivy)
- Push to registry

**Why needed**:
- Easy deployment without needing Java installed
- Consistent runtime environment
- Useful for Phase D (reliability/hardening)
- Later useful for containerized deployments

**Estimated runtime**: 3-5 minutes per build

**Not urgent** — defer until Phase D/E when deployment architecture is defined

## Integration with Project Goals

### Aligns with REFACTORING.md
- **Code Quality workflow** → Helps enforce issues #6-18 (clean code standards)
- **CI workflow** → Catches regressions during refactoring
- **Commit validation** → Ensures atomic, conventional commits per recommendation
- **Documentation validation** → Keeps REFACTORING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md in sync

### Aligns with ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Phase D (Reliability/Security)** → Dependency scanning + release workflow
- **Phase E (Advanced)** → Docker workflow for containerized deployment
- **General** → Branch protection requires CI passes before merging

### Aligns with your custom instructions
- **Conventional Commits** → Commitlint enforces your preference
- **Atomic commits** → Commit validation encourages small, focused changes
- **Test coverage** → CI validates tests pass before merging

---

## Branch Protection Rules

After implementing CI, recommend setting these GitHub branch protection rules on `main`:

```
Require status checks to pass before merging:
  ✓ build (CI: Build & Test)
  ✓ quality (Code Quality)
  ✓ conventional-commits (Commit Message Validation)
  
Require branches to be up to date before merging:
  ✓ Yes

Require code reviews:
  ✓ 1 review (optional, depending on team size)

Require approval of the latest reviewable push:
  ✓ Yes
```

This ensures all code merged to `main` has:
- ✅ Passed tests
- ✅ Met code quality standards
- ✅ Conventional commit format
- ✅ Up-to-date with main

## Implementation Timeline

**Total effort**: ~10-12 hours (~1-2 days)

| Phase | Workflows | Time | Priority |
|-------|-----------|------|----------|
| **Week 1** | CI, Quality, Dependabot | 5 hours | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Week 2** | Commits, Docs, Release | 5 hours | 🟡 HIGH |
| **Later** | Docker | 3 hours | 🔵 LOW |
