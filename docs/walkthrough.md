# Completion Walkthrough — Interactive CLI Presentation Layer & Terminal Configuration Fix

I have completed the presentation layer refactoring of the anime recommendation CLI and resolved the runtime initialization bug that threw `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: terminal must be set`.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Extracted Table Formatter Service
- **[TableFormatter.java](file:///Users/gordonpn/workspace/anime-recommendation/src/main/java/com/gordonpn/anime/service/recommendation/explanation/TableFormatter.java)** (New):
  - Created a dedicated presentation service that constructs high-fidelity output grids.
  - Implements `formatRecommendations`, `formatSeasonal`, and `formatSuggestions` methods.
  - Uses JLine 3's `AttributedStringBuilder` and `AttributedStyle` with unicode box-drawing characters (`│`, `─`, `┼`).
  - Renders grid lines in a muted grey color (`AttributedStyle.BLACK | AttributedStyle.BRIGHT`).
  - Employs conditional green bold formatting (`AttributedStyle.GREEN` / `AttributedStyle.BOLD`) to highlight high scores (> 8.0).
  - Corrected horizontal border line widths for `formatSeasonal` and `formatSuggestions` tables to resolve 1-character column separator misalignment offsets.

### 2. Implemented Asynchronous Status Spinner
- **[TerminalSpinner.java](file:///Users/gordonpn/workspace/anime-recommendation/src/main/java/com/gordonpn/anime/util/TerminalSpinner.java)** (New):
  - Implemented an `AutoCloseable` progress spinner utility.
  - Manages a daemon background thread that animates braille frames (`⠋`, `⠙`, `⠹`...) at an 80ms interval.
  - Employs escape carriage returns (`\r`) and erase-line instructions (`\033[K`) to dynamically render loader states on a single line.
  - Wipes itself cleanly from the terminal line buffer upon calling `close()`.

### 3. Integrated Spring Shell ComponentFlows
- **[RecommendationCommands.java](file:///Users/gordonpn/workspace/anime-recommendation/src/main/java/com/gordonpn/anime/commands/RecommendationCommands.java)**:
  - Removed old primitive string parsing methods (`promptString`, `promptBoolean`, `promptInt`).
  - Injected Spring Shell's native `ComponentFlow.Builder` and `Terminal`.
  - Configured conditional interactive wizard prompts utilizing arrow-key `SingleItemSelector` selections for boolean formats and multi-choice limits.
  - Wrapped MyAnimeList network-bound and database API executions within `try-with-resources` blocks using `TerminalSpinner`.
  - Delegated text grid compilation to the `TableFormatter` service.
  - Hardened context parsing with an exception-guarded helper `getSafe(...)` that handles missing or bypassed optional inputs without throwing `NoSuchElementException`.
  - Extracted the active `Terminal` instance dynamically and safely via `lineReaderProvider` in a new `getTerminal()` helper method, reverting to the constructor-injected terminal bean as a robust fallback.
  - Guarded all `TerminalSpinner` executions with a `json` flag check. When JSON output format is requested, the spinner thread execution is bypassed, preventing ANSI escape sequence pollution from corrupting stdout streams.
  - Added a multi-step conditional flow for the `freshnessBoost` and `decayMonths` parameter prompts: presents layman-friendly options ("None", "Low", "Medium", "High", "Custom" for freshness; "None", "Short", "Medium", "Long", "Custom" for decay) using `SingleItemSelector` prompts, and conditionally routes the user to custom input prompts (`freshnessBoostCustom` or `decayMonthsCustom`) only if they select "Custom".


### 4. Created Distraction-Free Analytics Dashboard
- **[RecommendationCommands.java](file:///Users/gordonpn/workspace/anime-recommendation/src/main/java/com/gordonpn/anime/commands/RecommendationCommands.java)**:
  - Added a new `dashboard` shell command.
  - Switches standard terminal scroll history to JLine's alternate screen buffer (`\033[?1049h`) and hides the cursor (`\033[?25l`).
  - Activates terminal raw keyboard mode (`terminal.enterRawMode()`) to receive immediate keypresses without waiting for Enter.
  - Runs a lightweight event poll loop allowing users to press `[r]` to refresh recommendations or `[q]` to cleanly restore standard terminal buffers (`\033[?1049l` & `\033[?25h`).

### 5. Automated Tests Preservation
- **[RecommendationCommandsTests.java](file:///Users/gordonpn/workspace/anime-recommendation/src/test/java/com/gordonpn/anime/commands/RecommendationCommandsTests.java)**:
  - Updated mock instantiation of the command class with the new dependencies.
  - Stubbed JLine's `Terminal` and `PrintWriter` behavior.
  - Mocked the fluent builder API sequences for Spring Shell `ComponentFlow` to verify interactive prompt configurations.
  - Added test cases covering both flow branches (preset select vs. custom input routing) and resolved Mockito's strict stubbing errors (`UnnecessaryStubbingException`).
  - Added `testRecommendationInteractivePromptsWithFilters` to verify option parsing works when minimum/maximum year filters and specific presets are input.
- **[ExplanationServiceTests.java](file:///Users/gordonpn/workspace/anime-recommendation/src/test/java/com/gordonpn/anime/service/recommendation/ExplanationServiceTests.java)** (New):
  - Created a dedicated unit test suite verifying list formatting for zero, some, and exceeding titles.
- **[TableFormatterTests.java](file:///Users/gordonpn/workspace/anime-recommendation/src/test/java/com/gordonpn/anime/service/recommendation/explanation/TableFormatterTests.java)** (New):
  - Created a dedicated unit test suite checking ANSI layout alignments, color styling, and title truncation on recommendation tables, seasonal tables, and suggestions tables.

### 6. Variety and Uniqueness Improvements in Recommendations
- **Candidate Franchise Grouping**:
  - Implemented connected-components BFS grouping for candidate recommendations. 
  - Recommended sequel/prequel/OVA seasons are consolidated under their most popular representative title, summing their recommendation occurrences and averaging franchise ratings to provide a distinct, diverse recommendations set.
- **Completed Franchise Exclusion**:
  - Added the `--exclude-completed` command flag and an interactive selection prompt.
  - When enabled (`true`), candidate recommendations belonging to any franchise the user has already watched are filtered out, encouraging the exploration of brand new shows.

### 7. Terminal Initialization Bug Fix
- **Removed custom `TuiComponentConfiguration.java`**:
  - Investigated the root cause of `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: terminal must be set`.
  - Identified that the custom `TuiComponentConfiguration.java` definition of the `componentFlowBuilder` bean overrode Spring Shell's standard auto-configured `ComponentFlow.Builder` bean.
  - The custom bean instantiated a raw `ComponentFlow.Builder` without injecting and setting the environment `Terminal`, `ResourceLoader`, or `TemplateExecutor` dependencies, resulting in null values at runtime.
  - Removed `TuiComponentConfiguration.java` entirely. This restores Spring Shell's native `ComponentFlowAutoConfiguration` which registers a fully-configured `ComponentFlow.Builder` bean with correct dependencies pre-wired.

## Verification & Validation Results

### 1. Automated Verification
We executed the full Gradle compile and test pipeline:
```bash
./gradlew test
```
*Output: BUILD SUCCESSFUL (all unit tests, mock flows, and seasonal grouping logic assertions pass).*

### 2. Manual Verification (CLI Execution)
- Ran the packaged JAR: `java -jar build/libs/anime-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
- Executed `recommendation` and confirmed:
  - Spinner animates correctly during data load.
  - Table formats output cleanly with cyan headers, green bold highlights, and muted borders.
  - Flow runs cleanly in both interactive systems and headless configurations without throwing initialization exceptions.
